What I learned from this demo:

* Work with EditText and SeekBar
* The editor of keyboard event handler with EditText
* Strings to formatted floats and strings remove specified prefix in kotlin

**And what I cannot resolve is the focus changes of EditText and auto-hided of keyboard, I hope I can work it later.**
