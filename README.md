What I learned from this demo:

* CardView is very cute, isn't is? (*I hate the gap between image nad text!*)
* Load json data through HttpURLConnection and display view with ViewStub
* Use `doAsync{}` and `uiThread{}` to do asynchronized task in Kotlin
* Read InputStream in Kotlin and convert string data to JSONObject

What I learned from this demo:

* The very basics of RecycleView
* RecycleView with custom ViewHolder and Adapter, and layout managers
* Using `lazy` delegates , and `Pair<out A, out B>` in Kotlin

**In fact it shows the unexpected results, but I will give more effort to the RecycleView app next time.**

What I learned from this demo:

* Work with LocationManager, get GPS providers and locations
* Got to know how to request specified Permissions at RunTime
* Use HttpUrlConnection to fetch data with url and read the input streams

**My network is not stable, and I really do a lot of hard-code, I think I can fix that later.**

What I learned from this demo:

* Work with EditText and SeekBar
* The editor of keyboard event handler with EditText
